## Development Setup
### Prerequisites
- OS: Linux or macOS
- IDE: Intellij (recommended) or equivalent IDE
- MySQL

### Project Setup
1. Setup the `supertokens-core` by following [this guide](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup). If you are not modifying the `supertokens-core` repo, then you do not need to fork that.
2. Start MySQL on port `3306`, listening to `locahost` or `0.0.0.0`.
3. Create a MySQL user (if not already exists) with username `root` and password `root`
4. Create a database called `supertokens`.
5. Fork the `supertokens-mysql-plugin` repository
6. Open `modules.txt` in the `supertokens-root` directory and change it so that it looks like (the last line has changed):
   ```
   // put module name like module name,branch name,github username(if contributing with a forked repository) and then call ./loadModules script        
   core,master
   plugin-interface,master
   mysql-plugin,master,<your github username>
   ```
7. Run `./loadModules` in the `supertokens-root` directory. This will clone your forked `supertokens-mysql-plugin` repo.
8. Follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#modifying-code) guide from `supertokens-core` repo for modifying and testing.
