## [3.0.0] - 2023-04-05

- Adds `use_static_key` `BOOLEAN` column into `session_info`
- Adds support for plugin inteface version 2.23

### Migration

- If using `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` false in the core:
  - `ALTER TABLE session_info ADD COLUMN use_static_key BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT(true);`
  - ```sql
    INSERT INTO jwt_signing_keys(key_id, key_string, algorithm, created_at)
      select CONCAT('s-', created_at_time) as key_id, value as key_string, 'RS256' as algorithm, created_at_time as created_at
      from session_access_token_signing_keys;
    ```
- If using `access_token_signing_key_dynamic` true (or not set) in the core:

## [2.4.0] - 2023-03-30

- Support for Dashboard Search

## [2.3.0] - 2023-03-27
- Support for TOTP recipe
- Support for active users

### Database changes

- Add new tables for TOTP recipe:
  - `totp_users` that stores the users that have enabled TOTP
  - `totp_user_devices` that stores devices (each device has its own secret) for each user
  - `totp_used_codes` that stores used codes for each user. This is to implement rate limiting and prevent replay attacks.
- Add `user_last_active` table to store the last active time of a user.

- Adds support for user migration
    - Updates the `password_hash` column in the `emailpassword_users` table from `VARCHAR(128)` to `VARCHAR(256)` to
      support more types of password hashes.

- For legacy users who are self hosting the SuperTokens core run the following command to update your database with the
  changes:
  `ALTER TABLE thirdparty_users MODIFY third_party_user_id VARCHAR(256); ALTER TABLE emailpassword_users MODIFY password_hash VARCHAR(256);`
